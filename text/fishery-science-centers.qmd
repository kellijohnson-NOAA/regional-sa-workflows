# Region Specific Workflow {#sec-regionworkflows}

  - Descriptions of the workflows by region and what separates them from other regions
  
  - Advances made by this region and the tools they use
  
  - Particular struggles or unique operations incorporated into their workflow
  
  - Table of resources used for their workflows

## AFSC {#sec-afsc}

Alternative way to reference section \nameref{sec-safe} rather than @sec-safe
*Note doesn't work with html render.


## NEFSC {#sec-nefsc}

Process variations:

  - Informal/verbal agreement for TOR guidelines for each stock
  
  - Standardized report template agreed upon by NOAA and the MAFMC AND NEFMC (agreed on in 2017)
  
    - Short and concise to make policy decisions (mgmt track specifically)
  
  - Report template is not publicly available but all done in latex (modular workflow)
  
    - Figures rendered outside (saved as png) then reference in doc
    
    - Tables created into tex files and referenced as component in template
    
  - Extensive work with 508 compliance
  
    - Contractors developing package for compliance to apply to template
    
Largest problems:

  - Lots of processing variables for 508 compliance
  
  - Even with all the work in the compliance, there is still a large effort into making it accessible (~2 week conversion for single analyst at the center)
  
  - Workflow still labor intensive
  
  - Large barrier to use template for new users
  
  - Only automated for management track reports
  
## NWFSC {#sec-nwfsc}

Process Variations:

  - Input data extractions are from an online database and state agencies
    
    - nwfscSurvey repo for west coast groundfish survey data
  
  - Use of sa4ss (maintained by scientist at NWFSC), package to make a template in github
  
  - All figures generated using r4ss functions
  
  - Standardized tables
  
  - Scripts are specific to species
  
  - Use of SS in the NW led to huge developments for packages that are tuned to its output such as r4ss and sa4ss
  
  - Process is not standardized for entire center (common among a lot of centers)
  
    - Some assessment scientists create a new repo for each assessment

Largest Issues:

  - Reproducibility
